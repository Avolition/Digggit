This is my submission for the final project of Udacity's React Redux course, forked from the [starter template here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). The initial template provided a simple backend RESTful server, to which the student is required to add a frontend UI with CRUD interactivity, similar to Reddit / Hacker News. I made some small edits to the backend server to allow for easier front-end development.
